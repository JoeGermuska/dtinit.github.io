Our newsletter has been going out by email without having our own permanent page and link here at dtinit.org, but here we are now with a blog section. We'll be continuing to send newsletters out by email, but also posting the contents as blog posts here for convenience of sharing and discovery.  

We have a Jekyll static site, thanks to the folks who initially set up the Data Transfer Project and its site.  Jekyll natively supports markdown files and blog post history, so we've added that into the site.  Stay tuned for more to come - both more newsletters, and more site content other than newsletters.
