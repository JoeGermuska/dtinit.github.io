## DTP Documentation

The Data Transfer Project (DTP) is an open source project that uses services' existing APIs and authorization mechanisms to access data. It then uses service specific adapters to transfer that data into a common format, and then back into the new serviceâ€™s API.

To get a more in-depth understanding, [this overview](/docs/dtp-documentation) may help as well as documentation in the [data-transfer-project repository](https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project).
