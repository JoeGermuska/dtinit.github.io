## The Federated Data Transfer Miniconference 
<div class="mustache"></div>

On September 27th and 28th, the Data Transfer Initiative, will be hosting our first online conference for social software developers, the Federated Data Transfer Miniconference.  

The miniconference is remote-only, and we’ll be hosting it on Jitsi - https://jitsi.org/ - with the technical details to come. 

We’re excited about our attendees list so far! We don’t want to give too much away, but on top of the world’s biggest ActivityPub projects and the world’s biggest tech companies we’re expecting guests from established Indieweb projects, small shops with promising new ideas, community safety and security professionals and even researchers who study developer mental health and thriving.

We’re also excited to announce our keynote speakers. Brian Fitzpatrick - founder of Google’s Data Liberation Front and creator of Google Takeout - will be opening the first day of the conference, and Lisa Dusseault - celebrated engineer, entrepreneur and CTO of the Data Transfer Initiative - kicking off day two. 

Our goal for this conference is to add to the existing fora helping connect the world’s federated service creators to each other, and to start a discussion about:

1. Usable - and sustainable - personal information mobility,
1. Community and administrative safety,
1. What do healthy approaches to mutualism and reciprocity look like, and
1. What guardrails around data integrity, liability and mutual support will be necessary for the federated internet to prosper and thrive.   

We believe that there is a great deal of freedom and opportunity in inter-service migration, for users and developers alike, but the risks to any system that lets the worst people in the world dump any elaboration of “history” into any Fediverse site they’re inclined to ruin can’t be ignored.

## The Agenda!

Day 1: Risks, Threats, Bad Actors and Attack Surfaces: 

1. Opening keynote from Brian Fitzpatrick 
1. A few brief administrative remarks on the process, questions, notetaking and agenda (5 mins max)
1. Breakout Discussions - The four


## Conference Participation Guidelines And Expected Conduct.

In order to ensure that this is a safe, welcoming and participatory event, we are adopting Mozilla's Community Participation Guidelines for this conference, with minor caveats.

https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/participation/

In particular, please review the section on behavior that will not be tolerated, including threats, personal attacks, unwelcome attention or disruptive behavior; the reporting contact for this event is <a href="mailto:mhoye@dtinit.org">Mike Hoye</a>. 

The minor caveat is this: while the Mozilla CPG outlines an investigation and appeals process, we don't have the resources to offer that process here. Because this event will be quite short, the Data Transfer Initiative is a small organization, the conference will be relatively brief, and the bar for basic human decency so easy to meet, the process we are offering is a judgement call from a moderator, possibly followed by summary expulsion from the conference for its duration. 

If you have questions, please email them to <a href="mailto:mhoye@dtinit.org">Mike Hoye</a>; we'll have more information here as we get closer to the day.
